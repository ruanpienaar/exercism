# Robot Simulator

Write a robot simulator.

A robot factory's test facility needs a program to verify robot movements.

The robots have three possible movements:

- turn right
- turn left
- advance

Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular
direction (north, east, south, or west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates,
e.g., {3,8}, with coordinates increasing to the north and east.

The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the
testing facility verifies the robot's new position, and in which
direction it is pointing.

- The letter-string "RAALAL" means:
  - Turn right
  - Advance twice
  - Turn left
  - Advance once
  - Turn left yet again
- Say a robot starts at {7, 3} facing north. Then running this stream
  of instructions should leave it at {9, 4} facing west.

For running the tests provided, only libraries delivered with recent
versions of erlang are used, so there is no need to install anything.

In order to run the tests, you can issue the following commands from
the exercise directory. Please substitute `$EXERCISE` with the
exercises name.

```sh
erl -make
erl -noshell -eval "eunit:test($EXERCISE, [verbose])" -s init stop
```
